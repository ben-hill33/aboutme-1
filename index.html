    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi my name is Davee. I'm a father to a 8 year old girl and 2 year old boy. I was born and raised in Houston, Tx. I served 5 years in the army. After that I worked as a private security contractor in the middle east for a company formerly known as Black Water. I've also owned my own business in Houston. It was a sign shop franchise called Signarama. I shut that down two years ago and moved to Washington state where I currently live.  </p>
